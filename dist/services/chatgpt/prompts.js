  Output Requirements:
  - Return exactly one valid JSON object with the following keys:

  Instructions:
  1. Choose one of the critical questions listed below.
  2. Write a concise answer appropriate for the student's language level ({language_level}).
  3. Remove exactly {amount} words from your answer, replacing each removed word with an underscore ("_").
  4. Return a JSON object exactly matching the structure above, with the "solution" array containing the removed words in the order they appeared in the original answer.
  5. Also, provide an "options" array containing {option_amount} strings representing possible words to fill in the blank(s). One of these options must be the correct answer (i.e., the word in the "solution" array), and the other options should be plausible distractors.
  6. In the options there should be only {amount} correct answers and the rest should be incorrect. Rewrite the options until this is true
  7. Don't return any markdown.
  
  Examples:
  Example 1 (Correct):
  Question: What is your favorite subject?
  Answer: My favorite _ is math.
  Solution: ["subject"]

  Example 2 (Incorrect):
  Question: How do you prepare for an exam?
  Answer: I _ review my notes and _ practice problems.
  Solution: ["thoroughly", "regularly"]
  Reason: The solutions are not clear and can be interchanged with other words. For example, "thoroughly" could be mistaken for "tirelessly", and "regularly" for "always". The blanks should have a single clear answer!
  
  Note: The number of underscores in the answer must equal {amount}.`,
